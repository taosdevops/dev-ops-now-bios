========================
I grew up being told that I was good at computers, but never considered making a career out of it - in fact, I was very adamant that I would _not_ be working on a computer. I liked the idea of working with food, and at the age of 14 I started working at a pizza shop across from my high school. I ultimately decided a career in culinary arts wasn't for me.

While attending Miami University of Ohio, I double-majored in East Asian Languages and Cultures (Chinese Language) and International Studies (Chinese separatism). I spent all of 2016 living in Beijing, and in 2017 returned to the USA to finish my schooling. That summer, I moved up to Montreal, Canada, where I planned to spend 6 months learning French in preparation of finding a job. Savings only went so far with my language courses, and by the time December 2017 rolled around, I found myself without much to do...

That's when I started learning Python.

My first project was a random character generator for my D&D campaigns, and my second was a data mining project scraping Chinese social media sites for a friend's thesis. These ended up being great introductions to programming, and I was able to score a position at Mindgeek working in their SEO department automating a lot of tasks. About 6 months in, I was put on a project to set up an Elasticsearch cluster for use by the department's analysts and it was then that I was introduced to DevOps. This was the only team I knew of that was using Python and **I wanted to learn more.** Within a month or two, I was transferred to their DevOps team, working as a junior devops engineer.

My Python skills and my understanding of various technologies have progressed so much since the day my then-manager had me setup my computer with Linux. Looking back, it's clear to me that this chain of events was life-changing and I couldn't be more happy with where I am today.

These days, I enjoy experimenting with fermented foods, hanging out with my cat, and taking care of my plants + garden.
