========================
I got a later start into technology than most people I know.  As a kid my dad had us live off grid because he was sure that there would be a war between the US and the USSR so we lived with no power, running water, etc, so my sister and I would be prepared for the end of the world.  I didn't use a computer for the first time until I was in middle school, and I love it.  My school had some old 486's that didn't work they were going to throw out, and I talked them into letting me fix one.

That was the start of my journey into technology, and it's never really stopped since then.  It was a couple more years before we had power and I could use it at home.  Later in life I was able to secure an internship at a web development shop in high school which I turned into a full time position with them.  My transition to what we know as devops started early as I didn't like doing things manually more than a couple times.

When I'm not hunched over a keyboard working or playing games, you can find me out on a motorcycle, or mountain bike.  My other love is music, I used to play in a couple metal and punk rock bands, and for a short time ran a record label.  When I can I like to see live music.
