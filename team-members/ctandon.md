========================
My youngest memory was getting caught red-handed with a screwdriver and my father's work laptop. Ever since I've been fascinated with taking things apart to learn how they work. Over the years, my ability to put them back together afterward has become just slightly more predictable.

I attended Rutgers University with plans to double major in Computer Science and Finance. While I loved accounting, I lacked passion for the rest of the business classes I would be taking. One day, I left the middle of a Business Law lecture and sat in on a Statistics lesson next door. I immediately fell in love and turned it into my second major.

My journey into DevOps began similarly. A failing build and little documentation on an old project needing reviving meant I needed to get my hands dirty. After spending the weekend getting a fix, I promised to never let manual process or documentation let me down. Instead, I incorporate writing expressive code, resilient pipelines, and beautiful automation into my work.

In my free time, you can find me taking long walks, watching hilariously bad TV, and spending time with my family. According to my friends, my music taste is "edgy-female" vocals. I don't know what that means.
