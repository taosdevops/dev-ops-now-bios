================
I like to make problems disappear.  If something is tedious and repetitive, I like to see it automated wherever it's permissible.  Sure, sometimes that means I need to buy Security types lunch to get them to listen, but I like it anyway.  Besides, who doesn't like lunch?

I started playing with computers sometime in the late 80s thanks to my dad bringing home a computer, and later got my hands dirty with some discard 386 systems from his job at Wang Labs.  I have a scar on my finger to prove it, case interiors in those days were full of sharp edges, and the metal was a lot thicker.  Between that and learning Basic in my free time with friends all through middle school, the obvious natural progression was Linux.

That's how I fell into the tail end of the dotcom boom, helped into my first job in the industry by a friend who also happened to be president of a games division.  Despite diving into the QA end of the pool, I still ended up dividing my time between that and the server room at my next couple of companies before diving into my own tech business in earnest.  Around that time, I also became a firefighter/EMT for several years, which was a lot simpler than buying my own health insurance and was good for staying in shape.  A meander through all sorts of things led me to specialize in Puppet for several years, which is how I first landed with Taos in 2014.

On the home front, I live with my wife and two mini dachshunds.  In my free time I generally go do things that don't involve screens, cooking, keeping a herb garden, some woodworking here and there, outdoor time when possible, and fiddling with a number of obsolescent and modern mechanical devices.
