My name is Noah, and I am originally from New York. My bachelor's degree was in Mathematics. While I liked the challenge, I found dealing with only abstract proofs rather frustrating.

I wanted something that would provide more tangible results.

I figured that coding would allow me to do problem solving in a more applied environment. So I found a program that trained me in DevOps and AWS, and later worked briefly for a consulting firm. I realized that I still gravitated towards math, and that Machine Learning was just Mathematics applied through code. As I began to study this more, I ended up discovering Taos who gave me the opportunity to provide technical support for Google Cloud's Big Data and AI products.

I have a penchant for data, math, coding, and anything that challenges me or expands my horizons. In my spare time, I enjoy going on walks, reading, and drawing.
