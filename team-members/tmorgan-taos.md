================
My interest in computing began around ten years of age after seeing my elder brother's PC building and CD burning side hustle. Initially enamoured with computers for the sake of gaming I eventually found that I really enjoy the complex ideas, interconnected systems, and problems to be solved in the field.

I started my career as in intern for a local ISP and hosted VoIP provider. From intern to director of IT my time there afforded me the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects in multiple disciplines: desktop and server support; network architecture and troubleshooting; telephony and faxing; logging and alering; etc..  After helping the company reach profitibility for the first time in a decade I moved on and joined the Taos team in 2014.

In my own time I enjoy exploring new ideas, consuming copious amounts of news, DIY projects, lifting weight, camping, fishing, backpacking, and bicycling. I also tend a garden and a half dozen rescued house plants.
